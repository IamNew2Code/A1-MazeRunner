Creational Design patterns
- can try to create the movements by using the factory pattern
First step would be to create a Movement interface that encompasses the different directions (going forward when facing East)
- should have a applyDirection() method which handles the adding to the Position potentially
- could have a getMovement() method which returns F, LF, or RF depending on the movement
Second step would be to create a MovementFactory 
    For example: if we need to go forward and are facing a certain direction we can return

Structural Design Pattern:
- Use flyweight to create the tiles in the Maze class
